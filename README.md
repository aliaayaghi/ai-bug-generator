Bug Report AI is a full-stack web app that turns a screenshot into a structured bug report. Upload a screenshot, let the AI analyze it, and get a complete draft report — ready to review, edit, save, and manage.

## 🚀 How It Works

```
User uploads screenshot
        ↓
Backend saves the image
        ↓
AI analyzes the screenshot
        ↓
Frontend shows generated bug report preview
        ↓
User saves / edits / starts over
        ↓
Saved reports live in the reports list
```

---

## 🗺️ User Flow

1. Upload a screenshot
2. AI analyzes it automatically
3. A read-only generated preview appears
4. Choose what to do next:
   - **Save Report** — persist it directly
   - **Edit** — tweak before saving
   - **Start Over** — upload a new screenshot
5. Open any saved report in a modal with full details + screenshot preview
6. Delete reports through a custom confirmation modal

## 🗄️ Database

SQLite is used for simplicity. Reports are stored with the following fields:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `title` | Report title |
| `summary` | Short description of the bug |
| `severity` | Bug severity level |
| `reproduction_steps` | Steps to reproduce |
| `expected_behavior` | What should happen |
| `actual_behavior` | What actually happens |
| `page_url` | URL where the bug occurred |
| `user_note` | Optional user note |
| `image_path` | Path to the uploaded screenshot |
| `suspected_area` | Area of the app suspected |
| `confidence` | AI confidence level |
| `created` | Timestamp |

Alembic is included for migrations.

## 🔌 API Overview

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/upload` | Upload an image file, returns saved file path |
| `POST` | `/api/analyze` | Send image to AI, returns generated report fields |
| `POST` | `/api/reports` | Save a bug report to the database |
| `GET` | `/api/reports` | Return all saved reports |
| `GET` | `/api/reports/{report_id}` | Return a single report |
| `DELETE` | `/api/reports/{report_id}` | Delete a report |
| `GET` | `/api/health` | Backend health check |

## 🛡️ Validation & Error Handling

The app handles the following edge cases:

- ❌ Invalid file type
- ❌ Empty file upload
- ❌ Oversized file upload
- ❌ AI analysis failure
- ❌ Save failure
- ❌ Delete failure
- ❌ Missing screenshot preview
- ❌ Empty saved reports state

> If AI analysis fails, the user can still continue and fill the report manually.

## 🎬 Demo Flow

```
1. Start backend and frontend
2. Open the frontend in your browser
3. Upload a screenshot
4. Wait for AI analysis
5. Review the generated preview
6. Edit if needed
7. Save the report
8. Open the saved report modal
9. Confirm screenshot preview works
10. Delete the report using the custom confirmation modal
```
